## Academic Integrity

### Can I get in trouble for using AI tools for my schoolwork?

Vibe University is designed to **help you learn**, not to do the work for you. Here's how to use it ethically:

✅ **Allowed:**
- Using AI to find sources and research papers
- Getting help with outlines and organization
- Checking grammar and citation formatting
- Understanding complex topics
- Generating practice quizzes
- Analyzing your own data

❌ **Not Allowed:**
- Submitting AI-generated text as your own without review
- Having AI write entire essays for you
- Using AI to bypass learning
- Not citing AI-generated ideas

**Important:** Always check your institution's AI use policy. When in doubt, ask your instructor.

### Will my instructor know I used AI?

Vibe University uses **transparent watermarking**:
- All AI-generated text has a blue background until you accept it
- You must review and accept (or modify) AI text before it's unmarked
- This ensures you're responsible for all content you submit
- Many instructors appreciate this transparency

Best practice: Mention in your assignment that you used Vibe University for research assistance and citation management.

### How do I know if I'm plagiarizing?

Use these Vibe University tools:

1. **detect_plagiarism** - Scans your document for potential plagiarism
2. **verify_citations** - Ensures all quotes and paraphrases are cited
3. **Citation Coverage** - Shows what % of your claims have sources

**Signs you might be plagiarizing:**
- ⚠️ Uncited direct quotes
- ⚠️ Paraphrases without citations
- ⚠️ Ideas from sources without attribution
- ⚠️ Large blocks of text from AI without modification

**How to avoid it:**
- Always cite your sources as you write
- Use quotation marks for direct quotes
- Paraphrase in your own words
- Give credit for ideas, even if you reword them

### Is using citation tools considered cheating?

**No!** Citation management is a standard academic practice. Tools like Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote have been used by students and researchers for decades. Vibe University's citation tools work the same way.

What matters is:
- ✅ The sources are real and relevant
- ✅ You actually read the sources
- ✅ You use sources to support your own arguments
- ❌ Don't cite sources you haven't read (citation padding)
- ❌ Don't fabricate sources

### Can Vibe University detect if I'm trying to cheat?

Yes. Vibe University has built-in integrity checks:
- **Fabricated citations** are flagged automatically
- **Suspicious patterns** (e.g., all sources from same year) are detected
- **Citation coverage analysis** shows if you're using enough sources
- **Plagiarism detection** catches uncited text

Remember: Vibe University is designed to help you succeed honestly, not to enable cheating.

## Citations & References

### What citation styles are supported?

Vibe University supports all major academic citation styles:
- **APA 7th Edition** (Psychology, Education, Social Sciences)
- **MLA 9th Edition** (Literature, Humanities)
- **Chicago 17th Edition** (History, Arts)
- **IEEE** (Engineering, Computer Science)
- **Harvard** (Business, Economics)
- **Vancouver** (Medicine, Life Sciences)

Custom CSL (Citation Style Language) styles can be imported for specialized requirements.

### How do I add a citation?

**Three ways:**

1. **AI Copilot:** Ask "Add a citation for Smith 2023 about climate change"
2. **DOI lookup:** Click **Insert Citation** → Enter DOI → Click **Insert**
3. **Manual search:** Click **Insert Citation** → Search by author/title

The citation will be inserted in-text and automatically added to your bibliography.

### What if a source doesn't have a DOI?

No problem! Vibe University supports:
- **DOI** (preferred for journal articles)
- **URL** (for websites, reports)
- **ISBN** (for books)
- **Manual entry** (for anything else)

You can enter citation details manually if the source isn't in online databases.

### How accurate is the citation formatting?

Vibe University uses **citation-js**, the industry-standard library used by academic institutions worldwide. Citation formatting is:
- ✅ **99%+ accurate** for standard sources
- ✅ **Validated** against official style guides
- ✅ **Regularly updated** with style guide changes

Always double-check important citations (like for thesis or publications) against the official style guide.

### Can I import citations from Zotero or Mendeley?

**Coming soon!** We're working on integrations with:
- Zotero (Q1 2026)
- Mendeley (Q1 2026)
- EndNote (Q2 2026)

For now, you can:
- Export from Zotero/Mendeley as BibTeX
- Import BibTeX into Vibe University
- Citations will be converted automatically

### How do I cite a website with no author?

Use the organization name as the author. For example:
- **APA:** (National Institute of Health, 2023)
- **MLA:** ("Article Title")
- **Chicago:** National Institute of Health

The citation tools will handle this automatically if you enter "Organization" as the author type.

### Can I cite social media posts?

Yes! Vibe University supports citations for:
- Twitter/X posts
- Facebook posts
- Reddit threads
- YouTube videos
- Podcasts
- Blog posts

Each citation style has specific formatting rules for digital sources.

## Export & Formatting

### What export formats are supported?

Vibe University exports to all standard formats:
- **PDF** - For final submission, printing
- **DOCX** (Word) - For editing, track changes
- **PPTX** (PowerPoint) - For presentations
- **XLSX** (Excel) - For spreadsheets and data
- **Markdown** - For version control, plain text

### Will my formatting be preserved when I export?

**Yes, mostly.** Export preservation rates:
- **PDF:** 98-100% (almost perfect)
- **DOCX:** 95-98% (very good)
- **PPTX:** 90-95% (good)
- **XLSX:** 95-98% (very good)

**Things that export perfectly:**
- Text formatting (bold, italic, headings)
- Citations and bibliography
- Page numbers and headers
- Tables and lists
- Line spacing and margins

**Things that may need adjustment:**
- Complex tables with merged cells
- Custom fonts (use common fonts for best results)
- Advanced charts (may need to be recreated)
- Comments and track changes (DOCX only)

**Best practice:** Always preview exports before submitting!

### Can I customize the export settings?

Yes! Click **Export → Advanced Options** to configure:

**PDF settings:**
- Paper size (Letter, A4, Legal)
- Orientation (Portrait, Landscape)
- Margins (Normal, Narrow, Wide, Custom)
- Line spacing (Single, 1.5, Double)

**PPTX settings:**

### Why is my PDF larger than expected?

PDF file size depends on:
- **Images:** Embedded images increase size significantly
- **Fonts:** Embedded fonts add 50-200KB per font
- **Length:** Longer documents = larger files
- **Charts:** Visualizations add size

**To reduce PDF size:**
- Compress images before inserting
- Use system fonts (Times, Arial, Helvetica)
- Export specific sections instead of entire document
- Use "Web optimized" export option

### Can I export to LaTeX?

Not yet, but it's planned for **Phase 6** (Q2 2026). For now:
- Export as Markdown
- Use a Markdown-to-LaTeX converter
- Or manually copy content to Overleaf

### Does Vibe University train AI models on my work?

**Absolutely not.** We do not:

The AI models we use (OpenAI, Anthropic) process your queries but don't train on them (per their API policies).

### Can I delete my data?

**Yes, anytime.** You can:
- Delete individual documents (instant)

- Request complete data deletion (within 30 days)

After deletion, your data is:

### What AI models does Vibe University use?

We use a combination of AI models:

- **Custom models** - For citation parsing, plagiarism detection

You can choose your preferred model in **Settings → AI Preferences** (premium feature).

### Does the AI "remember" my previous conversations?

**Only within a session.** The AI Copilot:

This is a privacy feature to prevent leaking information across documents.
