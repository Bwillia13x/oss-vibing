}

export const toolName = ({ writer }: Params) =>
  tool({
    description,  // Markdown description file
    inputSchema: z.object({
      // Zod schema for parameters
    }),
    execute: async (params, { toolCallId }) => {
      // Tool implementation
      // Returns formatted markdown message
    },
  })
```
