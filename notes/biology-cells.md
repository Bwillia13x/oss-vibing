# Biology Study Notes - Cell Biology

## Cellular Respiration

**Cellular Respiration**: The process by which cells break down glucose and other organic molecules to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of cells.

### Key Stages

**Glycolysis**: The first stage of cellular respiration that occurs in the cytoplasm, breaking down one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules, producing a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH.

**Krebs Cycle**: Also called the citric acid cycle, this stage occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and completes the oxidation of glucose derivatives, producing NADH and FADH2.

**Electron Transport Chain**: The final stage of aerobic respiration where NADH and FADH2 donate electrons, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis.

## Cell Division

**Mitosis**: A type of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Used for growth and tissue repair.

**Meiosis**: A specialized type of cell division that produces four haploid gametes (sex cells) with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Essential for sexual reproduction.

### Phases of Mitosis

- **Prophase**: Chromosomes condense and become visible, nuclear envelope breaks down, spindle fibers begin to form
- **Metaphase**: Chromosomes align at the cell's equator (metaphase plate), spindle fibers attach to centromeres
- **Anaphase**: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell
- **Telophase**: Nuclear envelopes reform around separated chromosomes, chromosomes begin to decondense

## Photosynthesis

**Photosynthesis**: The process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules, using carbon dioxide and water.

**Chloroplast**: The organelle where photosynthesis occurs in plant cells, containing chlorophyll and other pigments that capture light energy.

**Light Reactions**: The first stage of photosynthesis that occurs in the thylakoid membranes, converting light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) and releasing oxygen as a byproduct.

**Calvin Cycle**: The second stage of photosynthesis that occurs in the stroma, using ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose through carbon fixation.

## Cell Structure

**Cell Membrane**: A selectively permeable phospholipid bilayer that surrounds all cells, regulating the passage of substances in and out of the cell.

**Nucleus**: The control center of eukaryotic cells that contains genetic material (DNA) and coordinates cell activities including growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

**Mitochondria**: The powerhouse of the cell, organelles responsible for cellular respiration and ATP production through aerobic metabolism.

**Ribosomes**: Small organelles composed of RNA and proteins that synthesize proteins by translating messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences into amino acid chains.

## DNA and Genetics

**DNA**: Deoxyribonucleic acid, a double-helix molecule that carries genetic information and instructions for building and maintaining organisms.

**Gene**: A segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or functional RNA molecule, serving as the basic unit of heredity.

**Chromosome**: A thread-like structure made of DNA and proteins that carries genetic information; humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in each somatic cell.

**Mutation**: A permanent change in the DNA sequence that can be caused by errors in DNA replication or environmental factors, potentially affecting protein function.
