Create charts and visualizations from spreadsheet data.

This tool generates charts:
- Line charts for trends over time
- Bar charts for comparisons
- Scatter plots for correlations
- Pie charts for proportions
- Saves chart specifications to the sheet
- Optionally exports charts as images

Charts are linked to data ranges and update when source data changes.
