Analyze the argument structure of an academic document to identify thesis, claims, evidence, and logical flow.

This tool examines the rhetorical structure of academic writing to help students strengthen their arguments. It identifies:
- Main thesis statement and its clarity
- Supporting claims and sub-claims
- Evidence types (empirical, theoretical, anecdotal)
- Logical connections and transitions
- Counterarguments and rebuttals
- Argument gaps and weaknesses

Use this tool when:
- Student wants to strengthen their argument
- Document lacks clear logical structure
- Need to identify missing evidence or weak claims
- Preparing for peer review or submission

The tool works with documents in the `docs/` folder and can analyze papers across all academic disciplines (STEM, humanities, social sciences).
