Perform semantic search across academic papers to find conceptually related work.

This tool uses semantic similarity (beyond keyword matching) to find papers related to a query or document. It identifies:
- Papers with similar concepts and themes
- Related work using different terminology
- Papers in adjacent research areas
- Methodologically similar studies
- Papers addressing similar problems

Use this tool when:
- Looking for related work for literature review
- Finding papers that use similar methods
- Discovering adjacent research areas
- Need to go beyond keyword search
- Want to find papers with conceptual overlap

The tool works with references in the `references/` folder and can compare against a document or query. It uses text similarity algorithms to rank papers by relevance.
