Analyze spreadsheet data with statistical operations: describe, correlate, regress, pivot, clean.

This tool performs common data analysis tasks on spreadsheet ranges:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std dev, quartiles)

- Data cleaning (remove duplicates, handle missing values)

Results are tied to dataset snapshots with timestamps for reproducibility. All analysis includes provenance tracking.
