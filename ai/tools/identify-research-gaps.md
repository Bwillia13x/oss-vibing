Identify research gaps and opportunities in academic literature for a given topic.

This tool analyzes existing research to help students find unexplored areas, contradictions, or opportunities for contribution. It identifies:
- Areas with limited research
- Contradictory findings across studies
- Methodological gaps (e.g., quantitative vs. qualitative)
- Population or context gaps (e.g., understudied demographics)
- Temporal gaps (outdated research needing updates)
- Theoretical gaps (concepts needing frameworks)

Use this tool when:
- Starting a research project or literature review
- Looking for dissertation or thesis topics
- Trying to position your work within existing literature
- Need to justify research significance

The tool works with documents containing literature reviews or lists of references, and can suggest specific research questions that address identified gaps.
