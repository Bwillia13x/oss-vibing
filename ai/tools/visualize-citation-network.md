Visualize and analyze citation networks to understand research relationships and influence.

This tool creates interactive visualizations of how research papers cite each other, revealing:
- Citation clusters and research communities
- Influential papers (high citation counts)
- Citation paths between papers
- Co-citation patterns (papers cited together)
- Bibliographic coupling (papers citing the same sources)
- Research lineages and intellectual genealogy

Use this tool when:
- Mapping a research field or subfield
- Identifying seminal works and key researchers
- Understanding how ideas have evolved
- Finding related papers through citation links
- Discovering research communities and collaborations

The tool can work with references in the `references/` folder or analyze citations within documents. It generates both visual networks and quantitative metrics.
